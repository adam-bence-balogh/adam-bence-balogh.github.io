Hey there,  
my name is Adam Bence Balogh, I'm a Senior Software Engineer and a Java enthusiast.  
I have three oracle certifications (OCAJP 7 93%, OCPJP 7 95%, OCPJP 8 Upgrade 100%). During the preparation I made a lot of notes, docs and examples for myself which turned out to be useful to others as well. Partially this is why I started Exciting Java to share some of these documents as articles, and to revisit these topics. Over the years I read multiple books and took numerous courses about software engineering and processed them in the same way, therefore you can expect articles on other topics as well, e.g. Spring, Design Patterns, Testing, Best practices and many more. If you have any questions or you want to give feedback don't hesitate to contact me.  
  
Enjoy the excitment of Java :]
